## Reporting verbs
You do not need to change the tense if the reporting verb is in the present tense, if the original statement is still true.
**Eg.:** Tom ==wishes==: "People should eat less meat."
	Tom ==wishes== that people ate less meat.
	(he still wishes it)
## Imperative
Dad said : "Clean your room!"
Dat told us ==to clean== our room.
